			<h3>Bootstrap too heavy?</h3>
			<p>
				Bootstrap really propelled responsive design into the spotlight, but in recent years it has become a bit burdensome to get acquainted with and use. The core of Bootstrap got several things right and it is those key ideas that are at the heart of responsive design. While they are now hidden under lots of clutter in the most recent release, they are the center of attention in andi.

			<h3>Android and Iphone</h3>
			<p>
				andi was developed as a lightweight framework for mobile developers. I was on vacation and didn't have Bootstrap or jQuery handy, so I started writing my own framework on my Android phone for a browser game. I wrote my own error console and everything. After I finished the game, I realized that I was on to something and decided to make it available to everyone.
